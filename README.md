# Discord-Bot
Contains all the code for my discord bot, so I can maintain version control

Don't worry everyone I've taken my bot token out as that's not meant to be posted online

I made this because I haven't worked in python in a while and fancied picking it back up. I recently started using discord and thought trying to make a bot for it once I
realised discord allowed such things and saw what they could do.

The bot is designed to be fairly unintrusive, responding to events and carrying out simple tasks, automating a couple of basic bits and pieces in a discord server
(and its also a slight memelord XD)
